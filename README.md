# Handwritten-Digit-Classification

In this project the dataset we used was taken from the UCI machine learning repository in the name of Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set.
And I performed data standardisation ,PCA and other feature engineering and feature extaction techniques.

**1]**  

   The k-nearest neighbors method, how would you explain its use within the industry?


**Answer**

  The k-nearest neighbours is a supervised machine learning algorithm mostly used for classification and regression problems and some and some times KNN is also used for Recommendation systems. KNN will work by finding the nearest neighbour of the given input

   Changing the values of K that is the number of nearest neighbours will result in good accuracy. we can find it by creating a for loop and iterate over each values and we can find the best value of K to develop a model with good accuracy



  **KNN** algorithm follows three different Distance measurements of data points.


1. Euclidean Distance
2. Manhattan Distance
3. Minkowski  Distance
